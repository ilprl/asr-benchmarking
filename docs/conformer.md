# 🧠 Conformer – Overview

Conformer (Convolution-augmented Transformer) is a hybrid neural network architecture designed specifically for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). It combines the strengths of Transformers (global modeling) and convolutional neural networks (local feature extraction) to effectively capture both long-range dependencies and local acoustic patterns in speech.

Introduced by researchers at Google Research, Conformer achieves state-of-the-art results on several speech benchmarks while being efficient and robust in modeling raw audio sequences.
