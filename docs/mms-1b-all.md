# About MMS-1b-all

The mms-1b-all model is part of the Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS) initiative by Meta AI (formerly Facebook) and is a large-scale automatic speech recognition (ASR) model designed to handle over 1,000 languages

It uses a backbone architecture based on Wav2Vec2, and the “1b” refers to its size of about **1 billion parameters.**

The model is fine-tuned for ASR (speech-to-text) on a multilingual dataset extending across more than a thousand languages (with one version cited as 1,162 languages) at a standard audio sampling rate of 16 kHz.
