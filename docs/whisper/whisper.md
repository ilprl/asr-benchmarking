🧠 Whisper – Overview
Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model developed by OpenAI. Trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data, Whisper is capable of multilingual ASR, speech translation, and language identification. Unlike many models that require task-specific fine-tuning, Whisper is trained end-to-end and demonstrates strong zero-shot performance across a wide variety of speech-related tasks.

Whisper’s robustness comes from the scale and diversity of its training data, including both clean and noisy speech in many different languages.
